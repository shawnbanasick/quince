Digital Q Sorting for Desktop and Mobile

## What is this?

Quince is software for digital Q sorting. It is the combination of two previous Q sorting projects - EQ Web Sort (Shawn Banasick) and POETQ (Stephen Jeffares). The software consists of two parts - a ZIP file that contains the **Quince Template files**, and the **Configurator** that you will use to modify the template's 'settings' files to meet the needs of your Q sort project. Almost all aspects of the Q sort can be customized in Quince. No computer programming skills are required to create a Quince project. Everything can be done by pointing/clicking or by dragging/dropping.

Quince is open source software. The required online database service is free to use for projects with less than 1,000 participants. The only cost for a Quince project is the time you spend learning how to setup it up.

## Features

- step-by-step refinement process before Q sort (adapted from POETQ) which helps to reduce Q sort errors
- adaptive user interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- multilingual user interface (currently only 'left-to-right' languages can be used)
- optional participant questionnaire
- GDPR compliant database service
- detailed results report
- formatted results files for easy import into analysis software (KADE / PQMethod)
